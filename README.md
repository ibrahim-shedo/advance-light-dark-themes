Light/Dark Theme Toggle

Overview

This project implements a light/dark theme toggle feature for a web application. Users can switch between a light theme and a dark theme based on their preference. The toggle functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

Light theme: A clean and bright theme with light-colored elements for better readability in well-lit environments.
Dark theme: A sleek and modern theme with dark-colored elements for reduced eye strain in low-light environments.
Toggle switch: Users can easily switch between light and dark themes with a simple toggle button.
Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/light-dark-theme-toggle.git
Open the project directory in your code editor.
Navigate to the index.html file and open it in your web browser.
Use the toggle button to switch between light and dark themes.
Implementation

HTML: The structure of the web page is defined using HTML, including the toggle switch element.
CSS: Stylesheets are used to define the appearance of the light and dark themes, as well as the transition effects for the toggle switch.
JavaScript: Event listeners are added to the toggle switch to detect user interactions. When the switch is toggled, the data-theme attribute of the HTML body element is updated to switch between light and dark themes. This triggers corresponding CSS styles to be applied.
